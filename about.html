    <h1>About the Magic Formula</h1>
    <p>The Magic Formula is an investment strategy developed by Joel Greenblatt, a renowned value investor. This strategy is designed to help individual investors systematically identify undervalued companies with high potential for long-term growth.</p>
    
    <h2>How the Magic Formula Works</h2>
    <p>The Magic Formula relies on two key financial metrics to assess companies:</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Return on Capital (ROC):</strong> This measures how effectively a company generates profit from its investments. A higher ROC indicates that the company is generating more profit per dollar of invested capital, which is a sign of operational efficiency and profitability.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Earnings Yield (EY):</strong> This metric compares the company's earnings to its stock price, providing a way to determine how much "bang for the buck" investors are getting. A higher earnings yield can indicate that a stock is undervalued.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Applying the Magic Formula to Beat the Market</h2>
    <p>By ranking companies based on their ROC and EY, the Magic Formula aims to identify stocks that combine strong profitability with attractive valuations. Here’s a simplified guide on how to apply the Magic Formula in your portfolio:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Choose a list of companies from a broad market index (e.g., the S&P 500) and filter out financial and utility sectors, which may not be ideal for this formula.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Rank the remaining companies based on both ROC and EY. Each company receives two rankings, one for each metric.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Calculate the combined ranking for each company by adding its ROC and EY ranks. Companies with the lowest combined ranks are considered the best investments under the Magic Formula.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Invest in a select group of the top-ranked companies, typically over a 1-year period. Regularly rebalance the portfolio by selling underperformers and reinvesting in new top-ranked stocks.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Benefits of the Magic Formula</h2>
    <p>While no strategy is foolproof, the Magic Formula is based on fundamental value investing principles that aim to minimize risk and capitalize on long-term growth. Studies have shown that this strategy can deliver significant returns over time by focusing on quality companies trading at attractive valuations.</p>
    
    <p>However, it’s essential to remain patient and consistent with this approach, as the formula’s success typically becomes evident over longer time horizons.</p>
